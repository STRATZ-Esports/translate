  "faq.imp.score.question": "What does my IMP score mean?",
  "faq.imp.score.answer": "IMP varies from very low scores (less than 70), to very high scores (130 or greater).  An average IMP is 100.",
  "faq.imp.calculation.question": "How is IMP calculated?",
  "faq.imp.calculation.answer": "IMP compares global match stats based on match duration, hero, lane, role, and rank each week.  Using a machine-generated algorithm, billions of data points are compared against identical match scenarios, relying on match outcomes to identify the significance of any given sequence of actions and events.",

  "faq.legitimate.missing.answer": "STRATZ only records data from legitimate matches.",
  "faq.legitimate.legitimate.question": "What is a legitimate match?",
  "faq.legitimate.legitimate.answer": "A match must be at least 13 minutes long, having no abandons and no bots (detected by STRATZ), at least 5 kills total, no feeders (deaths/duration > 0.7).<br>Full stat analysis is available for legitimate matches that are ranked, battle cup, or league.",

  "faq.stats.stats.question": "Why do my numbers here differ from in-game?",
  "faq.stats.stats.answer": "In order to provide better accuracy, we attempt to recreate each game from scratch and calculate each value ourselves. We have found numerous bugs within the dota client. For example, you can Chronosphere your own teammates during a fight. If they die, you get an assist. We attempt to remove bugs like this with our own values.",
  "faq.role.determination.question": "How are core and support determined?",
  "faq.role.determination.answer": "First we split the teams, and look at each player individually.<br>We then look at each player’s CS score, and put players in slots in order from highest CS to lowest CS. <br>We also look to see if a player purchased what we consider to be support items. Full support items include things like Mekansm, Guardian Greaves, and Urn of Shadows. Regular support items include Wards, Gem of True Sight, Sentries, and Dust of Appearance. You get three points for every full support item you buy, and one point for every regular support item. <br>If you have the highest or second highest CS score on a team, you’re considered a core. <br>If you have the third highest CS score on a team and your last hits are greater than the total team CS times 16% or if your total support purchase count is greater than the total team support purchase value times 25%, then we consider you a support. if you meet neither of those criteria, we consider you a core. <br>If you have the fourth highest CS score on a team and your individual support value is greater than your team support value times 55%, We consider you a hard support. If your individual support value is greater than your team’s value times 25%, we consider you a light support. If neither of the above conditions are met, we consider you a core. <br>If you have the lowest CS score on a team and your individual support value is greater than your team times 50%, you’re a hard support. If your individual support value is greater than your team’s value times 20%, you’re light support. If neither of the above conditions are met, we consider you a core. <br>Note: We don’t differentiate between hard and light support status on the site.",
  "faq.awards.awards.question": "What are Match Awards?",
  "faq.awards.awards.answer": "After every match, the three awards below are given out.<br>MVP - Awarded to the player with the highest overall performance.<br>Top Core - Awarded to the player with the highest core performance.<br>Top Support - Awarded to the player with the highest support performance.",
  "faq.awards.determination.question": "How does Stratz determine who has the highest performance in a match?",
  "faq.awards.determination.answer": "Every player in every match receives a personal Stratz performance score. The performance score is calculated by comparing a player’s stats against the global average.<br>A score of 100 is considered average. Global averages are reset each week.<br>Hero, role, lane, match length, and skill tier are used to accurately and fairly calculate each score.",
  "faq.awards.not_every_min.question": "Why wasn’t every minute of my match counted towards my score?",
  "faq.awards.not_every_min.answer": "The final match score is taken 2 minutes before the end of the match. This helps prevent abusive behavior like fountain kills, courier feeds, etc, from influencing award outcomes.",
